			I feels passionate about FOSS and free, open physical spaces. Thus, got roped into this gig by the emcee one random winter night when trying to "kick it" and "kill time" on a whim. The hosting bar's aggressive hostility towards all distracting technology (seriously! absolutely no flat screen-TVs to be found! anti-smartphone signage plasters the walls with wacky adages) fully won the Webmaster over and before realizing it, this website was promised. The Webmaster has not written in the third person before in a long while. </p>
