		<h1>The Children’s Hour</h1>

			We are happy to announce the launch of a new wrinkle in the Open Piano story. Starting Wednesday, May 17, we will initiate a monthly Open Piano for kids, which we’ll call The Children’s Hour. It came, like so many things we do, organically and spontaneously, when several neighborhood moms came by and asked if their kids, in their first year or two of childhood piano lessons, could play. Open Piano has always been kid friendly so we brought them on. It was cute, of course, but their young energy was also refreshing, and they simply augmented the overall good vibe we try to create. 
			</br></br>So, we had a conference with Commy and came up with the monthly Children’s Hour, running from 6:30 to 7:30 pm, once a month, on whichever Wednesday best fits the children’s school schedules. We’ll announce that here, through MailChimp, and on our website, once that gets going.
			</br></br>This is going to be fun.
